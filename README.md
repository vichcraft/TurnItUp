# TurnItUp Chrome Extension

A modern Chrome extension to boost the volume of any media (audio/video) playing in your browser beyond 100% (up to 500%).

## Features
- Boost volume up to 5x (500%).
- Real-time control via a sleek popup UI.
- Preset buttons for quick adjustments.
- Works on all websites (YouTube, Netflix, Spotify Web, etc.).
- Persists volume settings per tab.

## How to Use
1.  Navigate to a website with audio or video (e.g., YouTube).
2.  Click the **TurnItUp** icon in your toolbar.
3.  Adjust the slider or click a preset button to increase the volume.
4.  **Note**: If the extension says "Ready" but doesn't seem to work, try clicking anywhere on the page first (Chrome requires user interaction before allowing audio manipulation).
